# Deadly-virus
This is the first really deadly virus I made
I tested this virus on a old computer that I had on windows 7 and the windows was destroyed
The only option was to install the windows again
Have fun with this!!!!

The file comes as a overwatch file i tryed to make it look like the real file
the only diffrence is the file size.

# What the virus does?
When you start the virus it will disable your Task Menager and delete reg values
After that i will delete system32 files and insult you for Opening it at the same time
and at the end it will shutdown you windows so the changes will take effect.

# How do I know the virus works?
The virus was tested on old computer and windows 7 and 8 on Vmware
And one time my friend and me tested it on other friend pc and it worked
Is pc needed a reboot after that.
